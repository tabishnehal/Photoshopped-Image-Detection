The system has been developed on Jupyter Notebook using Python3 and it’s basic libraries.  
Therefore, it is necessary for users to have Python3 and it’s basic libraries present on their system. 
It’s not necessary for users to install Jupyter Notebook. It’s upto their wish. 
Now, lets have a look on installation instructions.


Step to install implemented system

	1.Download the zip file named Mohd Tabish(17010116-6th).zip and place it to your desired path on your system.
	2.Unzip file.
	3.Now, if you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system:
		(a)Open command terminal.
		(b)Go to the directory where you have stored extracted zip file and go to the folder code.
		(c)Enter jupyter notebook on terminal and after some time a tab will open on your default web browser.
		(d)Open main.ipynb from the code folder. This is the main file of project where you will get to see output.
		(e)Now run main.ipynb file. If you would have every required and basic libraries of python installed,
		     you will encounter no error.

	4.Now, if you do not have Jupyter Notebook but have Python shell:
		(a)Open command terminal.33
		(b)Go to the directory where you have stored extracted zip file and go to the folder code.
		(c)Enter the following command in the terminal without quotes ”python main.py”.
		(d)If you would have every required and basic libraries of python installed, you will encounter no error.
