The proposed method will use key-point detection technique for forgery detection.There
are many key-point detection technique available like Harris Corner detection, Scale-
Invariant Feature Transform etc.I will be using Harris Corner since it is easy to understand
and simple to implement.The steps or methods which i am using in detection of Copy
Move Forgery are given:

1. Harris corner detector algorithm.
  (a) Color to gray scale.
  (b) Spatial derivative calculation.
  (c) Structure tensor setup.
  (d) Harris response calculation.
  (e) Non-maximum suppression.
2. Feature Descriptor.
3. Matching.
4. Transformation Estimation.
